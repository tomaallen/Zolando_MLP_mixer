MLP mixer architecture to classify Fashion-MNIST (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

This architecture was built as part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning module at Queen Mary University of London. Where stated, code is taken from lab notebooks written by demonstrators and teaching staff at Queen Mary. The my_utils.py file was generated from http://d2l.ai/. The final model achieved 90% accuracy on Fashion-MNIST.
